So even if you are already saving in the RSSB pension scheme, putting aside some additional savings into your Ejo Heza account will ensure that you have sufficient savings for a secure and dignified retirement and do not need to depend on others when you are old. Saving with Ejo Heza will also help you to accumulate savings for your other needs like children's education or housing.", " Ejo Heza is a voluntary, government-sponsored scheme available to all the citizens of Rwanda. Anyone working in the formal or informal sector, either self-employed or working for someone else, can join the scheme.
